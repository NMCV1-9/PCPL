PCPL (Python Compilable Programming Language)

PCPL style
	
	Strings:
		start: "
		end: "
		type: 0
	Indexing:
		start: <
		end: >
		type: 1
	Execute:
		start: {
		end: }
		type: 2
	Attributes:
		start: [
		end: ]
		type: 3
	Statements:
		start: (
		end: )
		type: 4
		
	Operations:
		Operators (JUFS-BASE-PACK):
			equal:
				type: E
			higher:
				type: H
			lower:
				type: L
			add:
				type: A
			subtract:
				type: S
			multiply:
				type: M
			divide:
				type: D
			remainder:
				type: R
		start: :
		end: ;
		BASE-type: 5
		Example-type: 5-H checks if argument 1 is higher than argument 2

Example instruction:

<indexobject{function,5}>

This would return the indexed thing from "indexobject" with the index from the result of the function named "function" that is given the argument "5".

Example instruction class:

class main():
	def IND(self, index):
		print("Indexing is not supported with this instruction")
		return (1)
	def EXEC(self, params):
		print("Execution is not supported with this instruction")
		return (1)
	def ATR(self, target):
		print("Getting an attribute is not supported with this instruction")
		return (1)
	def STAT(self, params):
		print("Statements are not supported with this instruction")
		return (1)
	def OP(self, arg1, arg2):
		print("Operations are not supported with this instruction")
		return (1)

!WARNING! in strings (between ") instead of , use . the dots will be replaced by , automatically
